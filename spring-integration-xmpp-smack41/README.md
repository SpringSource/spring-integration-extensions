Spring Integration XMPP Extension for the Smack 4.1
=================================================

This extension is done for the reason that we can't upgrade to the [Smack 4.1](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/)
with its breaking changes in the minor release for the Spring Integration 4.2. 
The upgrade is postponned to the [Spring Integration 4.3](https://jira.spring.io/browse/INT-3834) .

So, if you intended to use Smack 4.1 with existing Spring Integration 4.2, this extension is for you.

Functionally this projection is fully equvivalent to the Spring Integration XMPP module, so you can rely on the 
[Spring Integration Reference Manual](http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/xmpp.html) for more information.
