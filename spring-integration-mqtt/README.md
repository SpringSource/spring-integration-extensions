Spring Integration Mqtt Adapters
=================================================

`inbound` and `outbound` channel adapters are provided for Mqtt. The current implementation uses the [Eclipse Paho][] client.

Example configurations...

	<int-mqtt:message-driven-channel-adapter id="twoTopicsAdapter"
		client-id="foo"
		url="tcp://localhost:1883"
		topics="bar, baz"
		channel="out" />

	<int-mqtt:outbound-channel-adapter id="withDefaultConverter"
			client-id="foo"
			url="tcp://localhost:1883"
			default-qos="1"
			default-retained="true"
			default-topic="bar"
			channel="target" />


Spring integration messages sent to the outbound adapter can have headers `mqtt_topic, mqtt_qos, mqtt_retained` which will override the defaults configured on the adapter.

Inbound messages will have headers 

    mqtt_topic       - the topic from which the message was received
    mqtt_duplicate   - true if the message is a duplicate
    mqtt_qos         - the quality of service



Both adapters use a `MqttPahoClientFactory` to get a client instance; the same factory also provides connection options from configured properties (such as user/password). The client factory bean (`DefaultMqttPahoClientFactory`) is provided to the adapter using the `client-factory` attribute. When not provided, a default factory instance is used.


Currently tested with the RabbitMQ MQTT plugin.


##Note:

Currently, the Paho java client is not mavenized; there is an [open paho bug][] to resolve this. In the meantime, you can manually add the jar to your maven repo:

    mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.eclipse.paho -DartifactId=MQTT-Java -Dversion=3.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.jar
